# Pizza Project

main.py file should be run.

## Main menu
There are 3 buttons:
Sign up, sign in and login as administrator.
(Note: Admin name is Admin2020 and password is 20thisisadmin and it is stored as a private variable in Admin class)

## Sign up
You can create a new profile.

## Sign in
If you already have a profile, you can sign in using correct username and password.

You can view your purchases` history or order a new pizza - either select from menu or custom your own pizza.

## Admin
Admin can add a new pizza to the menu or delete a pizza from the menu.

## Database
 There are 2 databases: Pizzeria.db and users.db

 1 is used to store pizzas with their name, id, price and content.
2nd database is for users and there are 3 tables:
One to store username and corresponding passwords, 2 to store usernames and the id-s of their order and 3 to store order_id and the date_tie, price and content of the order.

First, Databe_pizzeria.py file is run and the databases are already created. Also, there are already some users that have been registered and ordered pizza and all this information is stored in database.
